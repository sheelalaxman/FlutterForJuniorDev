###### I have been hearing about how amazing the flutter is and I started to learn something new. 
 
## **what is a  flutter?** 
 **1)** Building a separate native android and iOS app not only increase time but cost also, that’s why companies ask for multi-platform           app development and that’s where flutter comes into the picture.\
 **2)** Flutter is a mobile app sdk for building high quality app from a single codebase that means write once and use on both the                  platform android and iOS.\
 **3)** It comes with a host of libraries which helps to maintain native look of an app that means android and iOS app will continue to             have their own native look.

## **How to get started?**
   Flutter use dart language so first and foremost need to learn dart. Well dart is pretty easy language to learn if you already know either of Java, Javascript, C++ or C# language it will take just few hours to get started, even same for the developer who have never coded in dart.\
